**⚠️⚠️⚠️ THESE SHADERS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR USE IN NORMAL GAMEPLAY! ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

These shaders are pretty janky, and designed specifically for the purpose of producing videos in the style of the Minecraft Acid Interstate. Entities and your hand are not visible.
If you want to achieve a similar effect in your game that's actually usable, use the [Acid Shaders](https://github.com/RYRY1002/acid-shaders-r7/).

This is my implementation of the [Minecraft Acid Interstate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geGziPUQD2U), a series of videos utilizing Minecraft shaders to create a trippy video synchronised to the music. The vast majority of the code in this repository is [Ebin Shaders](https://github.com/jbritain/Ebin-Shaders), which I have heavily modified to achieve the effects I wanted.

This shader was used in the production of my videos [Minecraft Acid Interstate V5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6S0WJlQVdk) [RED DESERT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bElPyxPfSzg). The specific code for those videos can be found in the [`v5`](https://github.com/jbritain/minecraft-acid-interstate/tree/v5) and [`red desert`](https://github.com/jbritain/minecraft-acid-interstate/tree/red-desert) branches repectively. The `main` branch serves only as a framework for any videos in this style I aim to produce, while branches for specific projects contain the configuration for the synchronised terrain distortions. Note that RED DESERT used a modified version of Sildur's Shaders instead
