**⚠️⚠️⚠️ THESE SHADERS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR USE IN NORMAL GAMEPLAY! ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

These shaders are pretty janky, and designed specifically for the purpose of producing videos in the style of the Minecraft Acid Interstate. Entities and your hand are not visible.
If you want to achieve a similar effect in your game that's actually usable, use the [Acid Shaders](https://github.com/RYRY1002/acid-shaders-r7/).

This is my implementation of the [Minecraft Acid Interstate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geGziPUQD2U), a series of videos utilizing Minecraft shaders to create a trippy video synchronised to the music. The vast majority of the code in this repository is [Sildur's Vibrant Shaders](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/), which I have heavily modified to achieve the effects I wanted.

This shader was used in the production of my video [RED DESERT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bElPyxPfSzg).This branch specifically contains the shader code for that video.
